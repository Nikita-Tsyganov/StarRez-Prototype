## Description

This is a UXPin prototype for the main project of Human-Computer Interaction course that I took at the University of Winnipeg.

[StarRez](https://housing-web.uwinnipeg.ca/StarRezPortal/Default.aspx) is a web portal which main task is to help you with managing your campus residence living. However, the design and overall usability are pretty bad(especially on mobile devices) which led to an idea of creating a mobile-friendly usable solution the prototype of which is presented here.

## How to run

OR

Download the repository to your machine.
Navigate to "StarRez-Prototype-master" folder.
Start the prototype by launching the index.html file in your browser.

## How to use

Just use it as if you would use a mobile app.
This is a prototype and the functionality is limited but you should be able to navigate through the screens and forms.
